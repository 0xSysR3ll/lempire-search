# Lempire Search

## :book: Introduction

After a nice conference made by [Palenath](https://github.com/megadose) @ Barbhack 2021 in Toulon , I decided to make a tool to exploit [Lampyre](https://lampyre.io/)'s API using a python3 script.

But why ?

To use Lampyre, you need to create an account. And with that account you can only make 4 free requests. In addition, each account must be verified via a link received by email.

This tool was not meant to be published but apparently several people have asked for it, so here it is

## :question: How to install

1. Clone the project

````bash
git clone https://github.com/0xSysR3ll/lempire-search
````

2. Install the required dependencies

```bash
cd lempire-search
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make a symbolic link

```bash
sudo ln -s lempire-search.py /usr/bin/lempire-search
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/lempire-search
```

4. Enjoy üòÄ

```bash
‚ùØ python3 lempire-search.py -h


 (                                                             
 )\ ) (                                                     )
